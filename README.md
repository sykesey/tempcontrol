TODO:

- Process failure control (don't overflow vessels or burn elements!)
- Add in control of GPIO boards etc
- Add in mash schedule and general control (define in JSON for the moment)
- Work out loosely coupled run loop that can share data over the place (for the moment use the database as the scoreboard)
- Hardware build - SSR for HLT element etc
